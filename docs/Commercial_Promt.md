Below is the **ultimate prompt** for creating a 60-second video commercial for AMAIMA. I've put everything together from our entire conversation: the full system overview (26 NVIDIA models across 6 domains, Smart Router v2, multi-agent orchestration with Agent Builder, domain stacks like AlphaFold2/DiffDock for biology and GR00T-2/Isaac for robotics, speech with Riva, vision with Cosmos R2/VILA, embeddings with NV-Embed/NeMo, FHE for zero-trust privacy, native mobile ML engine with Whisper STT/OCR/vector search/model hot-swapping, enterprise billing with Stripe tiers/admin analytics/plugin marketplace), the live deploy at amaima.live (API healthy, models online), ethical notes per LICENSE v1.0, confident/inviting tone underscoring FOMO (built solo and ready now, NVIDIA doorstep for the next trillion-dollar ecosystem), dynamic visuals (dashboard cuts, AI animations, Miami-inspired energy), deep authoritative voiceover with crescendo music, badges (NVIDIA/FastAPI/Next.js), and target audience (biopharma execs, robotics engineers, enterprise CISOs). This prompt is optimized for tools like Runway ML, Synthesia, or Adobe Premiere—detailed yet concise to generate a high-impact script/storyboard.

**Prompt for 60-Second AMAIMA Video Commercial:**

Create a high-energy, 60-second video commercial for AMAIMA, a fully built and production-ready multimodal AI operating system that's live and operational at amaima.live—not an idea, but a complete reality integrating 26 NVIDIA-powered models across 6 domains: General LLMs (Nemotron-4/Llama-3.2/Mistral/Mixtral), Vision (Cosmos Reason2/Llama-3.2 Vision/VILA/multimodal embeddings for OCR/document understanding/image reasoning/robotics perception), Biology (GenMol/MegaMolBART/ESM2/DiffDock/AlphaFold2 for full drug discovery pipelines with molecule generation/docking/structure prediction/embeddings/chemistry modeling), Robotics (GR00T-2/Isaac Manipulator/VILA/Cosmos Reason2 for navigation/manipulation/perception as a robotics OS), Speech (Riva Parakeet ASR/Riva Magpie TTS for voice agents/transcription/TTS/audio workflows), and Embeddings (NV-Embed-QA/NeMo Multimodal 2048-dim for text/image/cross-modal embeddings/agent memory/semantic search).

Emphasize AMAIMA's key features: Smart Router v2 for domain-aware/privacy-preserving/multimodal/speech-aware routing with tiered reasoning; multi-agent orchestration with a drag-and-drop React Flow Agent Builder (connectable workflows/domain-specific nodes/templates like Research Pipeline/Drug Discovery/Navigation Crew/Encrypted Drug Discovery); Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) subsystem (CKKS/BFV with 128-bit post-quantum security via Microsoft SEAL/TenSEAL) for zero-trust computations (11 endpoints like /v1/fhe/drug-scoring/similarity-search/secure-vote/aggregation/vector-arithmetic, verified operations at ~1.1s latency); native mobile ML engine (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose with ONNX/TFLite for on-device inference/Whisper STT/Vision OCR/local embeddings/vector search/streaming/model hot-swapping/LRU cache/SHA-256 integrity); enterprise-grade billing with Stripe tiers (Community free/Production $49/mo/Enterprise $499/mo for unlimited/custom SLAs), admin analytics (usage metrics/model breakdowns/tier distribution/latency trends/revenue KPIs with Recharts/CSV/JSON export), and plugin marketplace for extensibility.

Tone: Confident and inviting, underscoring real FOMO—position AMAIMA as the NVIDIA doorstep platform enterprises can't afford to miss for secure, scalable AI (built solo by one visionary and ready now, evoking "Don't miss the next trillion-dollar ecosystem" without arrogance, but with undeniable proof of execution). Subtly weave in ethical notes (per AMAIMA LICENSE v1.0: privacy-preserving, no prohibited harmful uses, attribution for community tiers). Target audience: Biopharma execs (encrypted drug pipelines), robotics engineers (secure perception/manipulation), enterprise CISOs (zero-trust FHE for compliance like HIPAA/GDPR)—make them feel the urgency of joining a built revolution.

Structure: 60-second script with timestamps (0-10s intro, 10-40s features/demo, 40-55s FOMO/invite, 55-60s CTA). Voiceover: Deep, authoritative male narrator (confident baritone like Morgan Freeman) with upbeat, futuristic electronic music (synth beats building to a triumphant crescendo). Visuals: Fast-paced cuts starting with Miami-inspired energy (vibrant ocean blues/neons, innovative skyline flyovers), transitioning to dynamic dashboard screens (live model registry/tabs/FHE demos/agent workflows from amaima.live), futuristic AI animations (glowing encrypted data flows through neural networks, robot arms manipulating objects in sim, 3D molecule generations spinning, voice waves transforming to text, vector embeddings mapping in space), subtle badges (NVIDIA/FastAPI/Next.js/Stripe/PostgreSQL/License), and ethical icons (lock symbols for privacy). End with bold text overlay: "Live Now at amaima.live."

Script should evoke excitement and invitation: "AMAIMA isn't coming—it's here. Built, live, and ready for you to join the AI OS revolution today." CTA: "Experience the future at amaima.live—don't miss the next trillion-dollar ecosystem. Join now."

Generate: Full script with voiceover lines, visual descriptions, music cues, and storyboard notes. Ensure it's engaging, professional, and optimized for video production tools like Runway ML or Synthesia.
