“Hi, I’m Jacque, the founder and sole developer behind AMAIMA — the world’s first multimodal, privacy‑preserving AI operating system.”

---

## **10–25s — The Why**
**Cut to AMAIMA dashboard visuals.**  
“I built AMAIMA because enterprises today face an impossible choice: capability or security.  
Cloud AI is powerful — but risky.  
Air‑gapped systems are safe — but limited.  
AMAIMA removes that tradeoff.”

---

## **25–45s — The What**
**Cut to model registry, agent builder, robotics/biology demos.**  
“It integrates twenty‑six NVIDIA models across six domains — vision, robotics, biology, speech, embeddings, and LLMs — all inside one unified platform.  
A smart router that optimizes cost and latency.  
A drag‑and‑drop agent builder for multimodal workflows.  
A native mobile engine for on‑device intelligence.”

---

## **45–65s — The Breakthrough**
**Cut to FHE dashboard, encrypted data animations.**  
“And for the first time ever, AMAIMA brings Fully Homomorphic Encryption into a multimodal AI OS.  
That means encrypted drug discovery, encrypted robotics perception, encrypted analytics — without ever exposing plaintext.  
It’s zero‑trust AI, with post‑quantum security, running in production today.”

---

## **65–80s — The Proof**
**Cut to Render dashboard, live API, mobile app.**  
“This isn’t a prototype.  
AMAIMA is live at amaima.live, with billing, analytics, mobile apps, and a full production backend.  
Every line of code — backend, frontend, mobile, agents, encryption — written by me.”

---

## **80–90s — The Invitation**
**Back to Meaghan on camera.**  
“If you’re building the future of biopharma, robotics, or enterprise AI — AMAIMA is ready for you.  
This is the AI OS for the physical world.  
And it’s live today.”
