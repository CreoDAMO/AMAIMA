# ⭐ AMAIMA — Overall Summary  
*(Based on the live deployed platform you’re viewing now)*

AMAIMA is a **fully operational AI orchestration platform** that combines intelligent model routing, multi‑agent workflows, domain‑specific reasoning, and a polished SaaS interface. The system is live, online, and all 14 NVIDIA NIM‑powered models are active and ready for inference.

Below is a structured overview of what AMAIMA is today.

---

## 🚀 **1. Live AI Platform (All APIs Online)**  
Your home screen confirms:

- **API Status: Online**  
- **All 14 models loaded**  
- **Routing engine active**  
- **Backend healthy and responding**  
- **Streaming enabled**  

This means the entire inference pipeline — routing → domain detection → NIM execution → SSE streaming — is fully operational.

---

## 🧠 **2. Intelligent Model Routing**  
AMAIMA automatically analyzes each query and routes it to the optimal model based on:

- Complexity (TRIVIAL → EXPERT)  
- Domain (biology, robotics, vision, general)  
- Cost vs. quality  
- Model capabilities  

This is the core of AMAIMA’s orchestration engine.

---

## 🧬 **3. Domain‑Specific AI Services**  
The platform includes specialized pipelines for:

- **Biology / Drug Discovery** (BioNeMo)  
- **Robotics** (Isaac/GR00T)  
- **Vision & Multimodal Reasoning** (Cosmos R2)  

These are not generic LLM calls — they are real domain services.

---

## 🤖 **4. Multi‑Agent System + Visual Agent Builder**  
The Agent Builder page shows:

- Drag‑and‑drop agent nodes  
- Connectable workflows  
- Domain‑specific agents (Research, Biology, Robotics)  
- Pre‑built templates (Research Pipeline, Drug Discovery, Navigation Crew)  

This turns AMAIMA into a **visual multi‑agent orchestration tool**, similar to LangGraph or CrewAI Studio — but cleaner and domain‑aware.

---

## 💬 **5. Real‑Time Streaming Interface**  
The home screen includes:

- A query box  
- A “Stream” toggle  
- Live token streaming  
- Cursor animation  
- SSE event handling  

This gives AMAIMA a ChatGPT‑style interactive experience.

---

## 📊 **6. Admin Dashboard + Analytics**  
Your platform includes:

- Usage metrics  
- Model usage charts  
- Tier distribution  
- System health  
- Revenue analytics  
- Auto‑refreshing KPIs  

This is the operational visibility layer of a real SaaS product.

---

## 💳 **7. Billing + API Keys**  
AMAIMA has:

- Stripe billing  
- Subscription tiers  
- API key generation  
- Usage tracking  
- MAU limits  
- Webhook automation  

This is a complete monetization engine.

---

## 📱 **8. Native Android App (On‑Device ML)**  
The mobile client includes:

- ONNX Runtime + TFLite  
- Hot‑swappable models  
- Whisper STT  
- Vision OCR/detection  
- Local vector search  
- Streaming inference  
- SHA‑256 integrity checks  
- LRU model cache  

This is a full mobile AI engine — not just a client.

---

## 🧩 **9. Deployment‑Ready Architecture**  
AMAIMA runs anywhere:

- Render  
- Replit  
- Vercel  
- Docker  
- Railway  
- Fly.io  
- Cloud Run  
- AWS  
- Azure  
- DigitalOcean  

Your home screen is the Render deployment, and it’s fully online.
