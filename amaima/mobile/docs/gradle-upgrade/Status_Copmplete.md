# Status Complete

I have successfully completed the migration and upgrade of the AMAIMA platform. Both the FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend workflows are running healthily, and the Android mobile configuration has been fully upgraded to the latest standards.

Key Accomplishments:
Backend & Frontend: Successfully migrated to the Replit environment with all dependencies installed and verified. Both services are active and responding to health checks.
Mobile Upgrade: Reconstructed the amaima/mobile/app/build.gradle.kts with proper app-level settings and finalized the project-wide upgrade to Gradle 9.3.1, AGP 9.0.1, and Kotlin 2.3.10.
Modern Standards: Transitioned the mobile app from kapt to KSP and targeted Android SDK 36 for future-proofing.
Clean Architecture: Maintained the separation of concerns across the three components (
Backend, Frontend, Mobile) and updated the replit.md to reflect the new state.

The project is now ready for production-level development. You can access the backend at port 8000 and the frontend at port 5000.
