AMAIMA License v1.0

**Advanced Multimodal AI Model Architecture License**  
**Version 1.0 – December 28, 2025**

**Copyright © 2025 Jacque Antoine DeGraff/Sovereign Spiral Development Framework (SSDF). All rights reserved.**

## Preamble and Purpose

This License governs the use, modification, distribution, and commercial exploitation of AMAIMA (Advanced Multimodal AI Model Architecture), including all source code, documentation, architecture specifications, algorithms, system designs, machine learning models, training pipelines, and associated intellectual property contained herein.

AMAIMA represents a novel and innovative system that integrates intelligent query routing, progressive quantized model loading, multi-layer verification pipelines, unified real-time communication protocols, and offline-first mobile orchestration. These innovations represent significant investment in research, development, and engineering and deserve appropriate protection while still enabling responsible collaboration and community engagement.

This License provides three distinct paths for users, balancing openness with protection, community growth with commercial viability, and ethical use with technological advancement. Users must explicitly select one license option, and compliance with the selected terms is required for continued use.

## Part I: Definitions

For the purposes of this License, the following definitions apply:

**"Software"** means all files, source code, object code, documentation, architecture diagrams, configuration files, machine learning models, training data, scripts, and associated materials included in or distributed with the AMAIMA project, including all modifications, derivatives, and contributions made by any party.

**"Novel Elements"** means the specific innovative components of AMAIMA that represent original intellectual property, including but not limited to: the five-level query complexity taxonomy with client-side machine learning preview; the progressive TensorRT-quantized model loading system with intelligent caching; the multi-layer verification pipeline integrating external security tools; the unified real-time communication protocol achieving cross-platform parity; the offline-first mobile architecture with on-device routing decision mirroring; the smart routing decision engine with feedback loop; and the DARPA AIxCC tool integration architecture.

**"Competing AI Orchestration System"** means any software system, service, or product that provides query routing, model selection, progressive loading, or verification capabilities for artificial intelligence models, whether commercial or open-source, that derives substantial functionality from the Novel Elements of AMAIMA.

**"Artificial Intelligence Training"** means the process of using software, data, or outputs to train, fine-tune, distill, compress, or otherwise improve any artificial intelligence, machine learning, or generative model, including large language models, diffusion models, transformer architectures, and similar systems.

**"Production Use"** means deployment or operation of the Software in a live environment serving end users, generating revenue, or supporting business operations, as distinguished from development, testing, research, or internal evaluation contexts.

## Part II: Novel Elements Protected

This License specifically protects the following Novel Elements of AMAIMA, which represent original innovations developed through significant research and development effort:

### II.A. Intelligent Query Routing System

The AMAIMA routing system classifies incoming queries across five complexity levels using both client-side machine learning preview and server-side confirmation. The taxonomy distinguishes between trivial, simple, moderate, complex, and expert queries, enabling optimal resource allocation. This system includes the complexity estimation algorithm, the feedback loop for continuous improvement, and the routing decision engine that selects appropriate model sizes and inference strategies.

### II.B. Progressive Model Loading Architecture

AMAIMA implements a sophisticated progressive loading system that preloads models in quantized TensorRT format, enabling sub-two-second cold starts while maintaining inference quality. The loading strategy includes intelligent caching, progressive resolution upgrades, and memory-efficient model management. This architecture significantly advances the state of the art in deployment efficiency for large language models.

### II.C. Multi-Layer Verification Pipeline

The verification system integrates multiple security and correctness tools, including DARPA AIxCC competition tools such as Buttercup for security scanning and SweetBaby for automatic patching. The pipeline implements iterative verification with user feedback integration, representing a novel approach to AI output validation and security assurance.

### II.D. Unified Real-Time Communication Protocol

AMAIMA achieves perfect parity between web, mobile, and backend implementations through a unified WebSocket-based protocol. This protocol supports streaming query responses, workflow execution updates, and real-time system notifications across all platforms simultaneously. The protocol design and implementation represent original innovations in distributed AI system communication.

### II.E. Offline-First Mobile Architecture

The Android implementation of AMAIMA includes on-device intelligence that mirrors server-side routing decisions, enabling offline operation with graceful degradation. This architecture includes the TensorFlow Lite integration for client-side complexity estimation, background synchronization through WorkManager, and local persistence through Room database with conflict resolution strategies.

### II.F. Smart Routing Feedback Loop

AMAIMA implements a continuous improvement mechanism that captures user feedback on query results and uses it to refine routing decisions, model selection, and verification parameters. This feedback loop represents a novel approach to AI system optimization through human-in-the-loop refinement.
