⚠  LEGAL NOTICE — READ BEFORE USE
This Agreement governs your access to and use of AMAIMA software, infrastructure, cryptographic systems, and AI models. By downloading, accessing, deploying, or using any part of AMAIMA, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree, you must not use AMAIMA. This Agreement includes export control acknowledgments, HIPAA obligations, CFIUS/COINS Act disclosures, EU AI Act compliance responsibilities, and quantum-safe cryptography terms that carry legal significance.


PART I — PREAMBLE AND PURPOSE
AMAIMA (Advanced Model-Aware AI Management Interface) is, as of February 2026, the world's first confirmed live privacy-preserving multimodal AI operating system. It integrates 26 NVIDIA NIM models across 7 intelligence domains — General LLMs, Vision, Biology, Robotics, Speech, Embeddings, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption — into a single unified platform with one API, one billing layer, one Smart Router, and a complete zero-trust cryptographic compute layer.
This Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is drafted to address a gap in the existing licensing landscape. No prior software license has been written for a system of this architecture: one that simultaneously operates in healthcare (HIPAA), defense (ITAR/EAR/DARPA), life sciences (biology domain), robotics (autonomous systems), and encrypted privacy-preserving compute (FHE) — all within a single codebase, all confirmed live in production.
The innovations protected herein represent original intellectual property with no precedent in commercial AI software: production-deployed Fully Homomorphic Encryption integrated into a multimodal AI operating system, enabling computation on encrypted data without decryption. This is not a research prototype. Microsoft built the cryptographic library (SEAL). AMAIMA built the application layer. Three independent frontier AI systems — Claude (Anthropic), Grok (xAI), and Microsoft Copilot — reviewed the platform independently and reached the same conclusion: this is the most complete AI platform built by a single developer.
This Agreement provides four distinct license tiers — Community, Production, Enterprise, and Government/Defense — calibrated to the regulatory obligations, commercial requirements, and national security implications of each use case. All tiers are subject to the Ethical Use Framework, Export Control Compliance requirements, and Quantum Security Provisions in this Agreement.
I.A. What This License Covers
All AMAIMA source code, compiled artifacts, containerized microservices, and documentation
The Smart Router v2 architecture and all routing logic, including FHE privacy detection
The Fully Homomorphic Encryption subsystem (CKKS + BFV via Microsoft SEAL/TenSEAL)
All NVIDIA NIM integration layers, API wrappers, and domain-specific endpoints
The zero-trust Visual Agent Builder (React Flow, 6 domain palettes, 7 FHE Privacy Nodes)
The mobile AI runtime (Android/Kotlin + ONNX Runtime + TFLite on-device intelligence)
All associated architecture specifications, training configurations, and novel algorithms
All derivative works, modifications, and contributions made under this Agreement
I.B. What This License Does Not Cover
The underlying NVIDIA NIM microservices (governed by NVIDIA AI Enterprise License — see Part VIII)
Microsoft SEAL / TenSEAL cryptographic libraries (governed by their respective MIT licenses)
Third-party open-source dependencies listed in the project NOTICE file
DARPA AIxCC tool integrations (Buttercup, SweetBaby) — governed by DARPA program terms
Output data generated by AI models through the AMAIMA platform for end users

PART II — DEFINITIONS
The following definitions apply throughout this Agreement:
II.A. Core Definitions
"Software"
All files, source code, object code, documentation, architecture specifications, cryptographic implementations, API schemas, Docker containers, mobile applications, configuration files, and associated materials constituting the AMAIMA platform, including all past and future versions and all modifications, derivatives, and contributions.
"Novel Elements"
The following original innovations constitute protectable intellectual property under this Agreement:
The Smart Router v2 — five-level complexity taxonomy with domain-aware routing, FHE privacy detection, and cross-domain chain-of-thought query planning across 26 NIM models
The FHE Subsystem — production-deployed Fully Homomorphic Encryption using CKKS and BFV schemes via Microsoft SEAL/TenSEAL with 128-bit RLWE post-quantum lattice security and ~1.1s inference latency
The Zero-Trust Agent Builder — visual React Flow workflow IDE with 7 FHE Privacy Nodes; the only encrypted AI workflow IDE in existence
The progressive TensorRT-quantized model loading system with intelligent domain-specific worker pool management and real-time model registry
The Offline-First Mobile AI Runtime — on-device routing logic mirroring server-side decisions with ONNX Runtime and TFLite integration
The multi-domain coexistence architecture enabling Biology, Robotics, Speech, Vision, Embeddings, and General LLMs to operate concurrently within one production system
The encrypted drug discovery pipeline — GenMol → DiffDock → AlphaFold2 → Encrypted Scoring — operating entirely on ciphertext
The multi-layer verification pipeline incorporating DARPA AIxCC tool integration architecture
"FHE Features"
All components of the Privacy-Preserving Computation System: CKKS scheme operations (approximate real-number arithmetic for ML inference), BFV scheme operations (exact integer arithmetic for secure voting and aggregation), encrypted API endpoints, privacy keyword detection within the Smart Router, encrypted drug scoring, secure vector similarity search, post-quantum security architecture, and all FHE workflow nodes in the Agent Builder.
"Competing AI Orchestration System"
Any software platform, service, or product providing query routing, model orchestration, multi-domain AI coordination, FHE-integrated AI compute, or visual agent building that derives substantial functionality from AMAIMA's Novel Elements — whether commercial or open-source, regardless of domain.
"Protected Health Information (PHI)"
As defined by HIPAA (45 CFR § 164.501): individually identifiable health information transmitted or maintained in any form. When AMAIMA processes PHI, Enterprise tier and a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) are required.
"Controlled Defense Information (CDI)"
Technical data, export-controlled information, or classified/controlled materials regulated under ITAR (22 CFR Parts 120–130), EAR (15 CFR Parts 730–774), or the COINS Act of 2025. Government/Defense tier required for any use involving CDI.
"High-Risk AI System" (EU AI Act)
AI systems classified as high-risk under Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. AMAIMA components used in medical diagnostics, employment screening, critical infrastructure, or biometric categorization in EU jurisdictions may qualify. Compliance obligations under Articles 9–16 apply to Deployers in the relevant tier.
"NVIDIA AI Enterprise License"
The license governing NVIDIA NIM microservices, available at docs.nvidia.com. Production deployment of NVIDIA NIM microservices requires a separate NVIDIA AI Enterprise Subscription (~$4,500/GPU/year or ~$1/GPU/hour). AMAIMA does not include or sublicense NVIDIA AI Enterprise rights.

PART III — NOVEL ELEMENTS AND IP PROTECTION
III.A. FHE Subsystem — The Irreproducibility Argument
The FHE subsystem represents a temporal moat that materially distinguishes AMAIMA from all prior AI software. Fully Homomorphic Encryption has been a research area for 15 years. AMAIMA deployed it in production. A well-funded 20-engineer team starting today cannot reproduce AMAIMA's FHE subsystem in under 24 months. This is not a claim about capability — it is a claim about chronology. The specific innovations protected are:
CKKS scheme integration for encrypted ML inference on NVIDIA's model stack — no prior art
BFV scheme integration for exact integer arithmetic in AI workflows — no prior art
Smart Router FHE privacy detection layer — automatic routing of sensitive queries to encrypted compute
7 FHE Privacy Nodes in a visual workflow IDE — no other agent builder has this capability
~1.1s production-competitive latency for encrypted inference — frontier performance (academic benchmarks show 1,000x–1,000,000x overhead; AMAIMA achieves 1.1s)
Encrypted drug discovery pipeline operating entirely on ciphertext: GenMol → DiffDock → AlphaFold2 → Encrypted Drug Scoring
III.B. Trade Secret Designation
The following constitute trade secrets under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1836) and applicable state law:
Smart Router v2 routing algorithms, complexity taxonomy weights, and FHE detection heuristics
Domain coexistence architecture patterns for concurrent multi-domain inference
Performance optimization configurations for FHE operations achieving ~1.1s latency
Cross-domain chain-of-thought routing logic for multi-model query execution plans
III.C. Patent Strategy Notice
AMAIMA's Novel Elements are the subject of ongoing patent review. Patent applications may be filed in the United States, European Union, and other jurisdictions covering the FHE-integrated AI OS architecture, Smart Router domain-aware routing with privacy detection, and the zero-trust visual agent builder with FHE workflow nodes. Use of Novel Elements for commercial purposes without a Commercial or Government/Defense license may constitute infringement of issued patents once filed.

PART V — NVIDIA AI ENTERPRISE LICENSE DISCLOSURE
REQUIRED DISCLOSURE — NVIDIA NIM Production Use
AMAIMA integrates 26 NVIDIA NIM microservices. Production deployment of NVIDIA NIM requires a separate NVIDIA AI Enterprise Subscription. AMAIMA does not sublicense NVIDIA AI Enterprise rights. This disclosure is legally required and must be presented to any Deployer using AMAIMA in production.


AMAIMA's value layer — the Smart Router, FHE subsystem, Agent Builder, domain coordination, billing, and mobile runtime — is original AMAIMA intellectual property. The underlying NIM model inference is NVIDIA intellectual property governed by NVIDIA's separate license terms.
V.A. NVIDIA License Requirements by Tier
Community License: NVIDIA Developer Program access sufficient for API prototyping
Production License: NVIDIA AI Enterprise Subscription required for production NIM use (~$4,500/GPU/year or ~$1/GPU/hour)
Enterprise License: AMAIMA provides NVIDIA AI Enterprise procurement guidance; Licensee obtains NVIDIA license independently
Government/Defense: NVIDIA AI Enterprise with specialized procurement; AMAIMA coordinates for DGX/air-gapped configurations
V.B. NVIDIA Telemetry Disclosure
NVIDIA NIM containers collect telemetry including microservice settings, usage data, and hardware environment. Deployers may disable telemetry by setting NIM_TELEMETRY_MODE=0. AMAIMA Enterprise and Government/Defense Licenses include guidance on telemetry configuration for regulated environments.

PART VI — FHE CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEM TERMS
FHE is a Mathematical Guarantee, Not a Policy
AMAIMA's FHE subsystem uses 128-bit RLWE lattice security — post-quantum resistant to Shor's algorithm and known quantum attacks. The server processes ciphertext; plaintext data never leaves the client. This is architecturally enforced, not policy-enforced.


VI.A. Cryptographic Specifications (For Legal Reference)
Encryption Library: Microsoft SEAL via TenSEAL — MIT licensed at github.com/microsoft/SEAL
CKKS Scheme: Approximate arithmetic for real-valued ML inference; bounded approximation error; suitable for drug scoring, embedding similarity, encrypted inference
BFV Scheme: Exact arithmetic for integer operations; suitable for secure voting, private aggregation, encrypted database queries
Security Parameter: 128-bit RLWE (Ring Learning With Errors) — post-quantum secure per NIST PQC standards
Quantum Resistance: Resistant to Shor's algorithm; based on lattice problems believed intractable by quantum computers
Production Latency: ~1.1 seconds per FHE operation — production-competitive for batch workflows
VI.B. EAR Encryption Export Compliance
AMAIMA's FHE subsystem constitutes strong dual-use encryption software under EAR Category 5, Part 2 (ECCNs 5D002 and 5E002). The following applies to all Licensees:
AMAIMA has submitted encryption registration to BIS and NSA per EAR License Exception ENC (§ 740.17) for mass-market and publicly available encryption
Licensees exporting or re-exporting AMAIMA (including the FHE subsystem) to foreign persons or jurisdictions must independently verify EAR compliance, including License Exception ENC eligibility for their specific transaction
Exports of AMAIMA with FHE Features to Country Group D:1 and D:5 nations are prohibited
ITAR § 120.54(a)(5): When AMAIMA's FHE encrypts technical data end-to-end and that data remains encrypted until decrypted by the authorized recipient, no ITAR-controlled event occurs. This is the architectural basis for AMAIMA's defense use case positioning.
Licensees are solely responsible for determining whether their specific use of FHE creates ITAR or EAR obligations based on the nature of the data processed
VI.C. FHE Tier Restrictions
Community: FHE demonstration and testing only. No production compute. Max 100 operations/month.
Production: Limited FHE testing (1,000 ops/month). Bias reporting required (see Part IX.C). No PHI or CDI.
Enterprise: Full FHE production. Unlimited operations. CKKS + BFV. PHI permitted with BAA.
Government/Defense: Full FHE with custom scheme configuration, air-gapped deployment, and classified inference pathway.

PART VII — HEALTHCARE DATA AND HIPAA COMPLIANCE
HIPAA — PHI Processing Requires Enterprise Tier + Signed BAA
Processing Protected Health Information (PHI) through AMAIMA requires (1) an Enterprise or Government/Defense License AND (2) a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Operating without a BAA while processing PHI is a direct HIPAA violation carrying fines up to $1.5 million per violation category per year.


VII.A. AMAIMA as Business Associate
Under HIPAA (45 CFR §§ 164.502(e) and 164.504(e)), AMAIMA functions as a Business Associate when processing PHI on behalf of Covered Entities. The BAA establishes AMAIMA's obligations for PHI handling, security safeguards, breach notification, and subcontractor management.
VII.B. FHE as HIPAA-by-Architecture
AMAIMA's FHE subsystem provides an architectural HIPAA compliance mechanism: PHI submitted through encrypted endpoints is processed as ciphertext. AMAIMA's servers never decrypt PHI — the mathematical structure of FHE prevents it. This constitutes HIPAA compliance by architecture rather than by policy or BAA covenant alone. However, a BAA is still legally required regardless of encryption architecture.
VII.C. Prohibited PHI Use
No PHI may be processed through Community or Production tier deployments under any circumstances
No PHI may be submitted to any AMAIMA endpoint without a signed BAA on file
PHI must not be used to train, fine-tune, or improve any AI model without explicit patient authorization under 45 CFR § 164.508
VII.D. 2025 HIPAA Security Rule Update
The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) proposed the first major HIPAA Security Rule update in 20 years in January 2025. The proposed rule removes the distinction between required and addressable safeguards and introduces stricter expectations for encryption and resilience. AMAIMA Enterprise BAA terms will be updated upon finalization to reflect these requirements.

PART VIII — EXPORT CONTROLS AND NATIONAL SECURITY
EXPORT CONTROL — Binding Acknowledgment Required
AMAIMA is subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and potentially the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). By accepting this Agreement, Licensee acknowledges understanding of and compliance obligations under U.S. export control law. Violations carry criminal penalties up to $1,000,000 and 20 years imprisonment (EAR § 764.3) and civil penalties up to $1,000,000 per violation (ITAR).


VIII.A. EAR Jurisdiction
AMAIMA is "subject to the EAR" as dual-use software under 15 CFR § 734.3. The FHE subsystem falls under ECCN 5D002 (encryption software) and 5E002 (related technology). AMAIMA uses License Exception ENC per EAR § 740.17 for eligible distributions. Licensees must independently verify ENC eligibility for their specific transaction and end-user.
VIII.B. ITAR Considerations for Defense Use
AMAIMA is not specially designed for military application and is not subject to ITAR as currently configured. However:
If Licensees use AMAIMA to process ITAR-controlled technical data, those data transfers remain subject to ITAR even if the platform itself is not ITAR-controlled
ITAR § 120.54(a)(5): AMAIMA's FHE architecture enables end-to-end encryption of technical data such that no controlled event occurs during transit if data remains encrypted until decrypted by an authorized U.S. person. Government/Defense Licensees should work with AMAIMA's defense team to document this protection.
Defense contractors should verify AMAIMA classification status before use in ITAR-controlled programs
VIII.C. Prohibited Jurisdictions
Export, re-export, or in-country transfer of AMAIMA or FHE Features is PROHIBITED to:
Entities on the BIS Entity List or the DDTC Debarred Parties List
Nationals or entities of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or Russia (per OFAC and EAR Country Group E:1 and E:2)
Countries designated as adversaries under the COINS Act of 2025 for AI technology transfers
VIII.D. CFIUS and COINS Act Compliance — Investor Screening
AMAIMA is a dual-use AI platform with FHE encryption capabilities that may qualify as a "critical technology" under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) for CFIUS purposes. The following applies to investment transactions involving AMAIMA:
Foreign investors seeking equity stakes with board rights, access to technical information, or governance rights in SSDF/AMAIMA should seek CFIUS pre-clearance before investment
The COINS Act of 2025 (signed December 18, 2025) expands outbound investment restrictions to AI systems. U.S. persons making investments in entities with nexus to countries of concern (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela) involving AMAIMA technology must comply with OISP notification requirements
Enterprise and Government/Defense Licensees with foreign investor participation receive CFIUS pre-screening documentation as part of their license package

PART IX — EU AI ACT AND INTERNATIONAL AI GOVERNANCE
IX.A. EU AI Act Risk Classification for AMAIMA Components
AMAIMA components may be classified at different risk levels under Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 depending on their deployment context:
General LLMs, Speech, Embeddings, and most Vision use cases: Limited Risk or Minimal Risk — transparency obligations apply (Article 50); GPAI model rules apply from August 2, 2025
Biology domain — drug discovery and molecular analysis: Generally exempt from AI Act as scientific research (EU pharma R&D exemption). If used for clinical decision support, High-Risk classification (Annex III, medical diagnostics) applies from August 2, 2027
Robotics domain — autonomous systems in safety-critical contexts: Potentially High-Risk (Annex III, critical infrastructure safety components)
FHE subsystem in healthcare context: The FHE architecture reduces risk by preventing server-side data access, but does not eliminate AI Act compliance obligations for the AI models processing encrypted data
IX.B. Compliance Responsibilities by Tier
Community and Production: Licensee bears sole responsibility for EU AI Act compliance for their deployment. AMAIMA provides no EU AI Act documentation for these tiers.
Enterprise: AMAIMA provides (1) technical documentation per Article 11, (2) instructions for deployers per Article 13, (3) human oversight design guidance per Article 14, (4) registration support for EU high-risk AI database, and (5) EU Authorized Representative designation assistance for non-EU Deployers.
Government/Defense: Full EU AI Act compliance package including Annex IV conformity assessment documentation, post-market surveillance plan template, and serious incident reporting protocol.
IX.C. NIST AI RMF Alignment
AMAIMA Enterprise and Government/Defense Licenses include alignment documentation for NIST AI Risk Management Framework 1.0 (GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE functions) and the NIST Generative AI Profile (NIST AI 600-1). This supports compliance with the Colorado AI Act affirmative defense, state-level AI governance requirements, and federal agency procurement requirements that reference NIST AI RMF.
IX.D. ISO/IEC 42001 — AI Management System
Enterprise Licensees may use AMAIMA's compliance documentation as a foundation for ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI Management System implementation. AMAIMA's architecture — particularly the FHE subsystem's mathematical privacy guarantees — supports "Privacy-Enhanced" trustworthiness attributes under NIST AI RMF and aligns with ISO 42001 requirements for data governance and human oversight.

PART X — ETHICAL USE FRAMEWORK
The Ethical Use Framework is binding under all license tiers. No license tier removes these restrictions.
X.A. Prohibited Applications — Absolute
Autonomous weapons systems designed to kill or harm humans without meaningful human oversight
Child sexual abuse material or any content facilitating child exploitation
Surveillance systems for ethnic, religious, or political group targeting
Social scoring systems that classify individuals to deny rights or opportunities
Real-time biometric identification of individuals in public spaces (prohibited under EU AI Act and adopted as global ethical standard)
FHE Features used to circumvent legitimate law enforcement access where court-ordered
Drug discovery applications for chemical or biological weapons development
Systems designed to facilitate human trafficking, slavery, or forced labor
X.B. FHE-Specific Ethical Requirements
FHE Features must not be used to hide personally identifiable data from lawful court orders or regulatory investigations
Licensees using FHE for healthcare must maintain the ability to provide decrypted data to patients upon request under HIPAA § 164.524
FHE implementations must not be marketed as providing absolute protection against all legal disclosure obligations — the encryption protects data from unauthorized access, not from lawful process
X.C. AI Training Restrictions
Community: AI training on Novel Elements strictly prohibited
Production: AI training on Novel Elements strictly prohibited
Enterprise: Limited AI training on non-FHE components permitted with written opt-in agreement; FHE subsystem training prohibited
Government/Defense: Custom terms negotiated per program requirements
X.D. Bias, Fairness, and Transparency Requirements
All Licensees: Must not deploy AMAIMA for automated high-stakes decisions (employment, credit, healthcare triage) without human oversight mechanisms
Enterprise and above: Must implement bias testing for Biology domain outputs used in drug efficacy assessments
All AI outputs must be clearly labeled as AI-generated where required by the EU AI Act (Article 50) and analogous state laws
X.E. Reporting
Report violations to: legal@amaima.ai. AMAIMA investigates all reported violations and will terminate licenses, pursue legal remedies, or refer to appropriate authorities. Whistleblower protections under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1833(b)) apply to good-faith reporting.

PART XI — QUANTUM SECURITY PROVISIONS
XI.A. Current Quantum Resistance Status
AMAIMA's FHE subsystem employs 128-bit RLWE (Ring Learning With Errors) lattice-based cryptography. This security parameter is believed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers including Shor's algorithm, which breaks RSA and ECC. RLWE is a candidate security primitive under NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization.
XI.B. Cryptographic Agility Commitment
AMAIMA commits to cryptographic agility: the FHE subsystem is designed to support scheme updates as NIST PQC standards finalize. Enterprise and Government/Defense Licensees receive priority access to post-quantum cryptography updates. AMAIMA will publish a migration path within 90 days of any NIST PQC standard that materially affects FHE security guarantees.
XI.C. Quantum Security Warranty Limitation
No warranty is made that AMAIMA's cryptographic systems will resist all future quantum attacks. The 128-bit RLWE parameter is the current frontier of practical post-quantum FHE security. Licensees in classified or long-horizon sensitive data environments should consult NSA's CNSA 2.0 Suite guidance and plan for cryptographic updates as the quantum threat evolves.

PART XII — GENERAL LEGAL PROVISIONS
XII.A. Governing Law

XIV.B. Acknowledgments
AMAIMA builds upon and acknowledges: Microsoft SEAL and TenSEAL teams (MIT License) for the cryptographic foundations of the FHE subsystem; NVIDIA NIM teams for the inference microservices that power AMAIMA's 26-model stack; Meta, Google DeepMind, and the open-source biology AI community for AlphaFold2, DiffDock, and the bio-domain models; the FastAPI, Next.js, CrewAI, and React Flow communities; and the DARPA AIxCC program for advancing AI security verification.
Three independent AI systems reviewed AMAIMA: Claude (Anthropic), Grok (xAI), and Microsoft Copilot. Microsoft Copilot — trained on Microsoft's own enterprise software and built on the SEAL library — reviewed amaima.live/fhe directly and stated this is the most complete AI platform seen from a single builder. Microsoft built SEAL. AMAIMA built the application.
