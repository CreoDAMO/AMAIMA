I'm trying to connect my custom domain, amaima.xyz but I'm having issues. It's a GoDaddy domain

Good news - your DNS is configured correctly! The domain check shows amaima.xyz is pointing to 216.24.57.1 (our load balancer IP) with no conflicting records.
The HTTP error you're seeing just means the SSL certificate hasn't been issued yet, which is normal when DNS is still propagating.
Here's what to do:
Add the domain in your Render Dashboard - Go to your service's Settings page, scroll to Custom Domains, and click "+ Add Custom Domain"
Your GoDaddy DNS is already set up correctly - You have the right A record pointing to 216.24.57.1
Verify the domain - Back in the Dashboard, click "Verify" next to your domain. If it fails initially, wait a few minutes for full DNS propagation
Once verified, we'll automatically issue your SSL certificate and your domain should work!

I did all of that it won't verify

Since your DNS is correctly configured but verification is still failing, here are the most likely causes:
DNS propagation delay - Even though your DNS shows correctly, it may not have fully propagated globally yet. Use WhatsMyDNS.net to check if most servers worldwide show your A record pointing to 216.24.57.1.
GoDaddy's additional records - GoDaddy sometimes adds extra A records when you use features like domain forwarding. These extra records can delay certificate issuance even if they don't show in your control panel. Check if any domain forwarding or parking features are enabled and disable them.
AAAA records - Make sure there are no AAAA (IPv6) records for your domain, as these prevent certificate issuance.
Try waiting a bit longer for propagation, then click Verify again. If it continues failing, check WhatsMyDNS to see if the propagation is complete globally.

Yes I added the CNAME and A on GitHub so I'm just waiting to see what happens
Jacque • 6h
I see the confusion - you mentioned adding records "on GitHub" but your domain amaima.xyz needs DNS records configured with GoDaddy (your domain registrar), not GitHub.
The domain check shows your DNS is actually configured correctly with GoDaddy - amaima.xyz points to our load balancer IP 216.24.57.1. The HTTP error just means the SSL certificate hasn't been issued yet.
Since your GoDaddy DNS is already correct, the verification delay is likely due to:
DNS propagation - Even correct records need time to propagate globally. Check WhatsMyDNS.net to see if most servers show your A record pointing to 216.24.57.1
GoDaddy's extra records - GoDaddy sometimes adds hidden A records when you use domain forwarding features, which can delay certificate issuance
Try clicking "Verify" again in your Render Dashboard. If it still fails, disable any domain forwarding or parking features in your GoDaddy account.

I mean GoDaddy my apologies

Perfect! Your DNS is actually configured correctly - the domain check confirms amaima.xyz points to our load balancer IP 216.24.57.1 with no conflicting records.
The verification delay is likely due to DNS propagation still completing globally. Even though your records are correct, it takes time for all DNS servers worldwide to update.
Here's what to check:
Check global propagation - Use WhatsMyDNS.net to see if most servers show your A record pointing to 216.24.57.1. If some still show old values, wait a bit longer.
GoDaddy's hidden records - GoDaddy sometimes adds extra A records when you use domain forwarding or parking features. These don't show in your control panel but can delay certificate issuance. Disable any domain forwarding features in your GoDaddy account.
Try clicking "Verify" again in your Render Dashboard. Since your DNS is correctly configured, it should work once propagation completes fully.

ok i added my domain over as www,amaima.xyz. its verified here but showing this The connection for this site is not secure
www.amaima.xyz sent an invalid response.
ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR

Great news - the domain check shows www.amaima.xyz is working perfectly with a 200 OK response! The ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR you're seeing is likely a browser caching issue.
Try these quick fixes:
Clear browser cache - Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) or try an incognito/private window
Wait a few minutes - Even though verification succeeded, SSL certificate propagation can take a bit longer to reach all edge servers
Try a different browser - This will confirm if it's browser-specific caching
Since our system shows your domain responding correctly with HTTPS, the SSL certificate has been issued and should work once your browser updates its cache.

still not working

The domain check shows www.amaima.xyz is responding with 200 OK, so your SSL certificate has been issued successfully. The ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR is likely browser caching or SSL propagation delay.
Try these steps:
Clear browser cache completely - Use Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac) to clear all cached data, not just a hard refresh.
Wait for SSL propagation - Even after certificate issuance, it takes time to reach all edge servers globally.
Test in incognito mode - This bypasses all cached data and should show if the SSL is working.
Since our system confirms your domain is responding correctly with HTTPS, the certificate is active and should work once your browser updates its cache.
