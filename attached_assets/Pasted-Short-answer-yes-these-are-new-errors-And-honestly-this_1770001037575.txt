Short answer: yes — these are new errors ✅
And honestly, this is good news, not bad.

Let me show you why, cleanly and concretely.


---

🟢 Why this is DEFINITIVELY a new class of error

❌ Old errors (earlier today)

Module not found

Path resolution failures

Alias mismatches

Filesystem not locating modules


Example:

> Can't resolve '@/app/core/lib/query/client'



⬆️ That meant “the file doesn’t exist at that path”


---

✅ Current error (now)

> Export queryClient doesn't exist in target module



This means:

✅ The file IS FOUND

✅ The alias IS WORKING

✅ Turbopack IS RESOLVING THE MODULE

❌ The symbol you’re importing does not exist in that file


This is a semantic error, not a filesystem error.

You moved from “can’t find the file” → “found the file, wrong export”
That is real forward progress.


---

🔍 What Turbopack is telling you (very explicitly)

> The export queryClient was not found in
src/app/core/lib/api/client.ts



Then it literally suggests:

> Did you mean to import apiClient?



That’s Turbopack saying:

> “I parsed this file. I know every export. queryClient is not one of them.”




---

🧠 Root Cause (now crystal clear)

You are mixing two different concepts:

Thing	Purpose

apiClient	HTTP client (Axios / fetch wrapper)
queryClient	React Query client


They should not live in the same file, and right now:

client.ts exports apiClient

Providers.tsx expects queryClient


So this import is logically wrong, even though the path is correct.


---

✅ The Correct Architectural Fix (this is the real fix)

1️⃣ Create a dedicated React Query client file

Create this file (new):

src/app/core/lib/query/query-client.ts

import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      retry: 1,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    },
  },
});

This file must only do React Query setup.


---

2️⃣ Fix the import in Providers.tsx

import { queryClient } from '@/app/core/lib/query/query-client';

✅ Path exists
✅ Export exists
✅ Correct responsibility
✅ Matches React Query best practices


---

3️⃣ Leave apiClient exactly where it is

Your existing file:

src/app/core/lib/api/client.ts

should continue exporting:

export const apiClient = ...

Do not merge these concepts.


---

🧩 Why this didn’t fail earlier in Replit

Replit dev mode:

Doesn’t statically analyze exports as strictly

Doesn’t enforce full SSR graph during dev

Can mask architectural drift


Vercel + Turbopack:

Parses everything

Knows every export

Fails fast (correctly)


This is exactly what production tooling should do.


---

🧠 Final Verdict

> These are new errors.

They prove:

Your aliases now work

Your paths are correct

Your build is almost done

Your architecture just needed one missing file




You are no longer debugging the platform.
You are finishing the app.


---

If you want, next I can:

do a 1-pass audit to ensure no other query/api crossovers exist

give you a canonical folder contract (api/, query/, providers/)

help you lock this with ESLint rules so it never regresses


You’re genuinely at the last mile now.
