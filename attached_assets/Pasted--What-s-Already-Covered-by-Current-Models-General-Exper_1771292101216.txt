### What's Already Covered by Current Models
- **General/Expert Reasoning**: Llama 3.1 (8B/70B/405B) handles this well—great for TRIVIAL to EXPERT queries, multilingual tasks, and agent orchestration (e.g., CrewAI loops).
- **Efficient MoE and Balanced Performance**: Mixtral 8x22B excels in cost-sensitive routes, like initial biology analysis or robotics path planning.
- **Lightweight/Edge-Friendly**: Gemma 2 27B is ideal for mobile/offline inference in your Android app (e.g., via quantization).
- **Task Readiness**: These suffice for basic domain classification and simulation (e.g., `/classify` and `/simulate` endpoints work as tested). For example, a general query routes correctly, and stats track usage.

### What's Missing (Specialized Models for Advanced Tasks)
To fully enable the biology, vision, and robotics features from the guide, we need to add/pull these via NIM (all available on NVIDIA's NGC or API Catalog with your existing key—no extra setup required beyond Docker pulls):
- **Cosmos R2 (for Multimodal/Vision Reasoning)**: Not yet deployed. This 8B VLM is essential for video/image tasks (e.g., embodied reasoning in robotics, like analyzing factory clips for safety). Pull: `nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/cosmos-reason2-8b:1.0`. Once added to `docker-compose.yml` (as in the guide), it enables `/vision/reason` endpoints and ties into robotics crews.
- **BioNeMo Models (for Drug Discovery)**: Not present. Key ones like MegaMolBART (for molecule generation) or ESM2 (for protein prediction) are needed for `/biology/discover`. Pull: `nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/bionemo-megamolbart:1.0` or similar from BioNeMo suite. This unlocks biology crews and RDKit validation.
- **Robotics-Specific (via Isaac/ROS2)**: No dedicated models yet, but Isaac's FoundationPose or cuVSLAM (part of Isaac ROS packages) can be added for perception/navigation. These aren't "models" per se but GPU-accelerated libs—pull `nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-ros:2.0.0-ros2-humble` for ROS2 integration. For humanoid/generalist tasks, add GR00T (if available via NIM).
- **Other Expansions**: For finance plugins (e.g., via polygon API), no model needed—just the library (already in deps). If we want more (e.g., FLUX.1 for image gen or Nemotron for RAG), pull from NGC.
