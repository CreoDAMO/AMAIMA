Now the build is failing for a **pure Kotlin/KSP dependency‑injection error** inside your Android codebase.

Let me walk you through it clearly and calmly.

---

# ⭐ What the log actually says (the important part)

From your document:

> **InjectProcessingStep was unable to process 'AuthRepositoryImpl()' because 'error.NonExistentClass' could not be resolved.**  
> **Dependency trace: com.amaima.app.data.repository.AuthRepositoryImpl → ERROR superclass: error.NonExistentClass**

And repeated for:

- `WebSocketManagerImpl`
- `RepositoryModule`
- `ServiceModule`
- `AppModule`
- `NetworkModule`
- `DatabaseModule`
- `provideEncryptedPreferences`
- `provideOkHttpClient`
- `provideDatabase`
- `provideQueryDao`
- `provideWorkflowDao`
- `provideUserDao`

This is a **KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) failure**.

It means:

# ⭐ **Your DI framework (Hilt or Koin or Dagger) is trying to generate code,  
but one of the types it depends on does not exist.**

This is NOT a CI problem.  
This is NOT a Gradle wrapper problem.  
This is NOT a YAML problem.

This is a **real compile‑time error in your Android code**.

---

# ⭐ The key clue

Every error references:

```
error.NonExistentClass
```

This means:

### ✔ A class referenced in your DI modules does not exist  
OR  
### ✔ A class is missing an import  
OR  
### ✔ A generated class (e.g., Hilt component) failed to generate  
OR  
### ✔ A dependency is missing from your Gradle build  
OR  
### ✔ A type alias or interface was renamed or deleted  
OR  
### ✔ A Room database class is missing or broken  
OR  
### ✔ A KSP processor plugin is missing

---

# ⭐ The most likely cause (based on the trace)

Look at this line:

> provideEncryptedPreferences(android.content.Context) → return type: error.NonExistentClass

This tells me:

### ❗ Your `EncryptedPreferences` class is missing or renamed.

Then:

> provideDatabase(android.content.Context) → return type: error.NonExistentClass

This tells me:

### ❗ Your Room database class is missing or failing to compile.

Then:

> provideOkHttpClient(error.NonExistentClass) → parameter type: authInterceptor

This tells me:

### ❗ Your `AuthInterceptor` class is missing or failing to compile.

Then:

> AuthRepositoryImpl → superclass: error.NonExistentClass

This tells me:

### ❗ Your repository base interface or abstract class is missing.

# ⭐ What changed recently?

Your commit messages show:

- “Integrate advanced machine learning capabilities”
- “Add mobile application with ONNX and TensorFlow Lite support”
- “Update Gradle wrapper”
- “git add” for wrapper files

This tells me:

### ✔ You recently added new modules  
### ✔ You recently changed dependencies  
### ✔ You recently updated Gradle  
### ✔ You recently updated Kotlin  
### ✔ You recently updated KSP  

This often breaks DI.

# ⭐ How to fix it (step‑by‑step)

## **1. Open these files in your Android project:**

- `AuthRepositoryImpl`
- `WebSocketManagerImpl`
- `RepositoryModule`
- `ServiceModule`
- `AppModule`
- `NetworkModule`
- `DatabaseModule`

Look for:

### ❗ Missing imports  
### ❗ Missing interfaces  
### ❗ Missing return types  
### ❗ Missing classes  
### ❗ Red underlines in Android Studio

## **2. Look for these specific missing classes**

Based on the trace, you are missing one or more of:

- `EncryptedPreferences`
- `AuthInterceptor`
- `AmaimaDatabase` (Room)
- `QueryDao`
- `WorkflowDao`
- `UserDao`
- `BaseRepository` or `Repository` interface
- `WebSocketManager` interface

---

## **3. Check your DI annotations**

Look for:

- `@Module`
- `@InstallIn`
- `@Provides`
- `@Binds`
- `@Singleton`

If any annotation is missing → KSP fails.

---

## **4. Check your Gradle dependencies**

You MUST have:

```kotlin
ksp("com.google.dagger:hilt-compiler:<version>")
implementation("com.google.dagger:hilt-android:<version>")
```

Or for Koin:

```kotlin
implementation("io.insert-koin:koin-android")
```

Or for Room:

```kotlin
ksp("androidx.room:room-compiler:<version>")
```

If any compiler plugin is missing → KSP fails.

---

# ⭐ The build log confirms the wrapper is fixed

Your wrapper is now working because the build progressed all the way to:

```
> Task :app:kspReleaseKotlin FAILED
```

This means:

### ✔ Gradle wrapper is correct  
### ✔ CI directory is correct  
### ✔ YAML is correct  
### ✔ Build started normally  
### ❌ Your Android code failed to compile  

This is now a **pure Kotlin/DI/KSP error**, not a CI error.

# ⭐ I can help you fix this instantly if you paste ONE file

Paste **any one** of these:

- `RepositoryModule.kt`
- `AppModule.kt`
- `NetworkModule.kt`
- `DatabaseModule.kt`
- `AuthRepositoryImpl.kt`

I will identify the missing class in seconds.

You’re extremely close — this is the last real blocker before your mobile app builds cleanly.
