You’re right in the middle of your **Android CI/CD pipeline** on Render/GitHub Actions, and the error you’re seeing is one of the most classic Android build failures:

# ❌ **“Cannot find Gradle wrapper jar file. Please check your project setup.”**

This happens when GitHub Actions tries to run:

```
./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

…but your repository **does not contain the Gradle wrapper files** that Android projects require.

Let me break down exactly what this means and how to fix it cleanly.

---

# ⭐ Why This Error Happens

Your Android project must include the following files:

```
gradlew
gradlew.bat
gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
```

If **any one** of these is missing, GitHub Actions cannot run the build.

Your CI log is telling you:

> **Cannot find Gradle wrapper jar file**

Which means:

### ✔ `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` is missing  
or  
### ✔ the entire `gradle/wrapper/` folder is missing  
or  
### ✔ the wrapper was never committed to GitHub  

This is extremely common when:

- The wrapper wasn’t generated locally  
- The wrapper folder was accidentally deleted  
- `.gitignore` excluded the wrapper  
- The project was copied without the wrapper  
- Replit or Render stripped the folder

# ⭐ How to Fix It (Fastest Path)

## **1. Regenerate the Gradle wrapper locally**
Open your Android project locally and run:

```
./gradlew wrapper
```

or, if `gradlew` itself is missing:

```
gradle wrapper
```

This regenerates:

```
gradlew
gradlew.bat
gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties
```

---

## **2. Commit the wrapper files to GitHub**
Make sure these files are in your repo:

```
git add gradlew
git add gradlew.bat
git add gradle/wrapper/*
git commit -m "Add Gradle wrapper"
git push
```

---

## **3. Re-run your GitHub Action**
Once the wrapper is present, your CI/CD pipeline will run:

```
./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon
```

successfully.

# ⭐ Additional Checks (Based on Your Setup)

Since your **frontend and backend are deployed on Render**, and your **Android CI/CD is running on GitHub Actions**, make sure:

### ✔ Your Android project is in the correct folder  
If your repo root contains AMAIMA backend + frontend + mobile, your workflow must `cd` into the mobile folder:

```
working-directory: ./mobile
```

Otherwise GitHub Actions will look for `gradlew` in the wrong place.
